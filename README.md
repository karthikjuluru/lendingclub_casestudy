## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
    - A consumer finance company specializing in urban loans faces critical risks in its loan approval process. Approving loans for applicants likely to default leads to financial losses, while rejecting loans for creditworthy applicants results in missed business opportunities. This project aims to analyze applicant profiles to develop predictive insights that optimize loan approval decisions, balancing profitability and risk.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    - The business problem is to accurately predict the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting, enabling the company to balance minimizing financial losses from defaults and maximizing profits by approving loans for creditworthy applicants.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    - Dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.

## Conclusions
- Verified Loans also have a surprisingly high number of defaults.
- Loan amount ranging between 0 to 15000 are also defaulted.
- Surprisingly employees with more than 10years are defaulted.
- Distribution of Loan Amounts taken (for Charged-Off Loans) : The distribution of loan amounts is right-skewed, with most loans concentrated in the 0 to 15000 range, peaking at 5000 to 10000. Higher loan amounts above 30000 are rare, indicating limited demand or approval for large loans.
- Distribution of Annual Income (for Charged-Off Loans) : The distribution of annual income is again right-skewed, with most number of defaults done by individuals earning between 20000 to 70000, peaking around 40000. Individuals having higher income levels above 100000 are less likely to be defaulters.
- Distribution of Employment Length (for Charged-Off Loans) : The chart indicates that the highest number of charged-off loans occur for individuals with 10+ years of employment. There is a relatively lower and more even distribution of charged-off loans for employment lengths from 0 to 9 years.
- Distribution of Interest Rate (for Charged-Off Loans) : The histogram shows that charged-off loans are most frequent at interest rates between 10.73% and 15.29%.
- Distribution of Home Ownership : This indicates that renters are at a higher risk of having charged-off loans compared to property owners and other types of ownership.
- Distribution of Verification Status : This count plot indicates that loans that are not verified are at higher risk for charge-offs.
